#A lexical sample

To observe some of these high level institutions, I draw sets of journals from four social science disciplines–anthropology, sociology, economics, and political science–and I draw these in blocks from the same publisher. Journals were selected from the disciplinary affiliations signaled in their titles. From a JSTOR master list of archived materials, journals were selected if they contained any of the disciplinary prefixes anth-, soci-, econ-, and poli-. {{Though not all journals that are affiliated with a discipline signal this with a word containing the signature prefix, those that do are affiliated with a high degree of accuracy. Soci is an exception, and journals like the Royal Society of Statistics [madeup] are excluded.}} This list was cross referenced with the TR WOK database.

Following these trends in the use of prefixes, we develop a sample or journals that use them under the assumption that these signal domain relevance for the disciplines.





We reduce the sampling frame in several steps. First, we require that the journal publisher be located in the United States. Second, we require that the journal be included in the JSTOR database. Third, we require that the journal title contain, with some exceptions, at least one of the prefixes . Of the  journals in the WOK master list, these criteria limit the sample to  titles or less than half of a percent of the original sampling frame.











The WOK master as of  listed  titles. It is not clear what sample of historical population of journals this represents, but it is a substantial substantive starting point. 











The source data are  observations on  documents spanning  years.









Each study depends on a database of records of the contents of journals. This database is compiled from two sources, JSTOR and the Thompson Reuters Web of Knowledge Social Science Citation Index (WOK).
