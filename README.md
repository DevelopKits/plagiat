# Welcome!

This repo tracks versions of Brooks Ambrose's dissertation for a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles.

The workflow is based on `docker` and is organized into four images.

 * bench
 * resources
 * work

 `bench` contains the operating system and all third party software installations. `resources` contains all source data and user written software libraries. `work` contains literate programming documents.
