# Welcome!

This repo tracks versions of Brooks Ambrose's dissertation for a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles.

The workflow is based on `docker` and is organized into four images:

 * `bench` containing the operating system and all third party software installations,
 * `resources` containing all research source data and user written software, and
 * `work` containing all literate programming documents and typeset manuscripts.

The built `work` image represents the project in its entirety and when run will produce the exact manuscript submitted for publication.
